# About
This project creates an *Arena* which contains *lights* and *creatures* that show swarming behavior. As part of the design, classes and inheritance was used in design. This was created using *Python 3* and the visualization was done using *Turtle graphics*.  
**Professor: Dr. Amy Larson**.  
**CSCI 1133 at UMN, Twin Cities**.

## What is Swarming Behavior?
 Swarming behavior seen in animals such as birds, fish, and bees can be simulated in artificial life with relatively simple rules. If each animal is attracted to a source (e.g. food or light) but has a rule to maintain space between it and other things, then swarming behavior emerges. In this project, a collection of artificial life forms with light sources that attract some of the creatures but repel others was created.
